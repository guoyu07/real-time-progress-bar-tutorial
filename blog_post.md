When I browse the web, there's nothing less helpful than a spinning wheel or a progress bar that doesn't give me any feedback on what is actually happening. It usually happen when the application is working on a task that needs some time to process like data or file import, provisioning an account or a big search query. 

This usually leave me, the poor user, wondering if something wrong with the app? Should I wait 5 more minutes before I refresh the page? As a user, this is such a frustrating experience!

To cope with this problem and improve the user experience in your app, you should use a real-time progress bar. Lucky for you, Pusher make it dead easy for your to build one!


## The problem

For this demo, we will use the all too common problem of when someone create and account and the app needs to provision the account with a demo environment for example.

## As easy as 1, 2, 3

For the sake of this demo, I will be using a small Sinatra app for the server side logic but obviously this will work with any kind of frameworks or languages.
